# Mentoring-Program-Impact-Evaluation

STAT409 Project:

This R Markdown file contains the part of the project which centers on exploratory analysis of mentoring participation at Washougal High School. Using a cleaned and merged dataset of weekly studentâ€“course records, I examined how mentored students were distributed across courses, subjects, and semesters. I explored enrollment patterns, identified where mentored students clustered, and compared participation across different academic areas. Visualizations built with dplyr, ggplot2, and gridExtra helped reveal trends and concentrations that helped later with modeling.
